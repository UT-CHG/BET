Try different ways of discretizing the probability measure on D defined as a uniform
probability measure on a rectangle (since D is 2-dimensional).
    
unif_unif creates a uniform measure on a hyperbox with dimensions relative to the
size of the circumscribed hyperbox of the set D using the bin_ratio. A total of M samples
are drawn within a slightly larger scaled hyperbox to discretize this measure defining
M total generalized contour events in Lambda. The reason a slightly larger scaled hyperbox
is used to draw the samples to discretize D is because otherwise every generalized contour
event will have non-zero probability which obviously defeats the purpose of "localizing"
the probability within a subset of D.
    
uniform_hyperrectangle uses the same measure defined in the same way as unif_unif, but the
difference is in the discretization which is on a regular grid defined by center_pts_per_edge.
If center_pts_per_edge = 1, then the contour event corresponding to the entire support of rho_D
is approximated as a single event. This is done by carefully placing a regular 3x3 grid (since D=2 in
this case) of points in D with the center point of the grid in the center of the support of
the measure and the other points placed outside of the rectangle defining the support to define
a total of 9 contour events with 8 of them having exactly zero probability.

If using a regular grid of sampling (if random_sample = False), we set
    
  lambda_emulate = samples
  
Otherwise, play around with num_l_emulate. A value of 1E2 will probably
give poor results while results become fairly consistent with values 
that are approximately 10x the number of samples.
   
Note that you can always use
    
  lambda_emulate = samples
        
and this simply will imply that a standard Monte Carlo assumption is
being used, which in a measure-theoretic context implies that each 
Voronoi cell is assumed to have the same measure. This type of 
approximation is more reasonable for large n_samples due to the slow 
convergence rate of Monte Carlo (it converges like 1/sqrt(n_samples)).

At this point, the only thing that should change in the plotP.* inputs
should be either the nbins values or sigma (which influences the kernel
density estimation with smaller values implying a density estimate that
looks more like a histogram and larger values smoothing out the values
more).
    
There are ways to determine "optimal" smoothing parameters (e.g., see CV, GCV,
and other similar methods), but we have not incorporated these into the code
as lower-dimensional marginal plots have limited value in understanding the
structure of a high dimensional non-parametric probability measure.
