"""
This example solves a stochastic inverse problem for a
linear 3-to-2 map. We refer to the map as the QoI map,
or just a QoI. We refer to the range of the QoI map as
the data space.
The 3-D input space is discretized with i.i.d. uniform
random samples or a regular grid of samples.
We refer to the input space as the parameter space,
and use parameter to refer to a particular
point (e.g., a particular random sample) in this space.

A reference parameter is used to define a reference QoI datum
and a uniform probability measure is defined on a small box
centered at this datum.
The measure on the data space is discretized either randomly
or deterministically, and this discretized measure is then
inverted by BET to determine a probability measure on the
parameter space whose support contains the measurable sets
of probable parameters.
We use emulation to estimate the measures of sets defined by
the random discretizations.
1D and 2D marginals are calculated, smoothed, and plotted.

Try with and without random sampling.

If using random sampling, try num_samples = 1E3 and 1E4.
What happens when num_samples = 1E2?
Try using 'lhs' instead of 'random' in the random_sample_set.

If using regular sampling, try different numbers of samples
per dimension.

A standard Monte Carlo (MC) assumption is that every Voronoi cell
has the same volume. If a regular grid of samples was used, then
the standard MC assumption is true.

See what happens if the MC assumption is not assumed to be true, and
if different numbers of points are used to estimate the volumes of
the Voronoi cells.

At this point, the only thing that should change in the plotP.* inputs
should be either the nbins values or sigma (which influences the kernel
density estimation with smaller values implying a density estimate that
looks more like a histogram and larger values smoothing out the values
more).

There are ways to determine "optimal" smoothing parameters (e.g., see CV, GCV,
and other similar methods), but we have not incorporated these into the code
as lower-dimensional marginal plots generally have limited value in understanding
the structure of a high dimensional non-parametric probability measure.
