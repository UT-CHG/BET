    "Consider a thin 2-dimensional (square) metal plate constructed by welding together two rectangular metal plates of similar alloy types together. The alloy types differ due to variations in the manufacturing of the rectangular plates, so the thermal diffusivity is different on the left and right sides of the resulting square plate. We want to quantify uncertainties in these thermal diffusivities using the heat equation to model experiments where the square plates are subject to an external, localized, source at the center of the plate. Assuming we have exactly two contact thermometers with which to record exactly two temperature measurements during the experiment, the question is the following: what are the optimal placements of these thermometers in space-time?"

Here, we take the simulated data from the model problem saved as *.mat files that contains parameter samples chosen in clusters around 16 random points in the input space, and the corresponding QoIs (data) from the points in space shown in Figure 6 of the manuscript at the 50 time steps of the simulation (resulting in 1000 total different possible QoIs to choose from in space-time). We use the clusters of samples to compute gradients of the QoI using either radial basis function, forward, or centered finite difference schemes. These gradients are used to compute the average skewness in the possible 2D maps. We then choose the optimal set of 2 QoIs to use in the inverse problem by minimizing average skewness."

    "Computing the skewness (or other criteria such as scaling of measures of inverse sets described in [Experimental Design : Optimizing Quantities of Interest to Reliably Reduce the Uncertainty in Model Input Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06702)) requires a sensitivity analysis. If the code used to generate possible QoI data does not also produce derivatives with respect to model parameters (e.g., by using adjoints), then we can use several different types of finite differencing. Assuming the user wants to work strictly with random sampling (to possibly re-use samples in the parameter space for solving the resulting stochastic inverse problem), then we can compute derivatives using a radial basis function finite difference scheme. Otherwise, we can use typical finite differencing schemes (forward or centered) on regular grids of parameter samples. Understanding the code, derivative capabilities, and/or the types of sampling in the parameter space is crucial to setting up how the gradients of QoI are computed/loaded into this code. We provide data files for different types of sampling in the parameter space in `BET/examples/`:"
