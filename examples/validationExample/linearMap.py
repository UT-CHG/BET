Compute the output distribution simple function approximation by
propagating a different set of samples to implicitly define a Voronoi
discretization of the data space, and then propagating i.i.d. uniform
samples to bin into these cells.

See the effect of using different values for d_distr_samples_num.
Choosing 

  d_distr_samples_num = 1
  
produces exactly the right answer and is equivalent to assigning a
uniform probability to each data sample above (why?). 

Try setting this to 2, 5, 10, 50, and 100. Can you explain what you 
are seeing? To see an exaggerated effect, try using random sampling
above with n_samples set to 1E2.

If using a regular grid of sampling (if random_sample = False), we set
    
  lambda_emulate = samples
  
Otherwise, play around with num_l_emulate. A value of 1E2 will probably
give poor results while results become fairly consistent with values 
that are approximately 10x the number of samples.
   
Note that you can always use
    
  lambda_emulate = samples
        
and this simply will imply that a standard Monte Carlo assumption is
being used, which in a measure-theoretic context implies that each 
Voronoi cell is assumed to have the same measure. This type of 
approximation is more reasonable for large n_samples due to the slow 
convergence rate of Monte Carlo (it converges like 1/sqrt(n_samples)).

At this point, the only thing that should change in the plotP.* inputs
should be either the nbins values or sigma (which influences the kernel
density estimation with smaller values implying a density estimate that
looks more like a histogram and larger values smoothing out the values
more).
    
There are ways to determine "optimal" smoothing parameters (e.g., see CV, GCV,
and other similar methods), but we have not incorporated these into the code
as lower-dimensional marginal plots have limited value in understanding the
structure of a high dimensional non-parametric probability measure.
