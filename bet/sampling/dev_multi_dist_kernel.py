    The goal is to make a sampling that is robust to different types of
    distributions on QoI, i.e., we do not know a priori where the regions of
    high probability are in D. This class provides a method for determining the
    proposed step size as follows. We keep track of the change of the QoI
    values from one sample to the next compared to the total range of QoI
    values explored so far. If a big relative change is detected, then you know
    that you have come across a region with larger derivatives and you should
    place more samples around there to resolve the induced regions of
    generalized contours, i.e., reduce the step size. If the change in QoI
    values is relatively small, you are in a region where there is little
    sensitivity, so take larger step sizes.
