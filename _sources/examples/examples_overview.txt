Computational Method for Inverse Sensitivity Problems III: Multiple Quantities of Interest 
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/130930406>`_ for the formulation of the stochastic
inverse problem in a measure theoretic framework along with proofs of existence
and uniqueness of solutions, `Solving Stochastic Inverse Problems using Sigma-Algebras on Contour Maps 
<http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3851>`_ for the convergence 
and error analysis of the non-intrusive algorithm, and

hydrodynamic models <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2015.01.011>`_ for a less technical description
of the method for engineers as well as application to a physically relevant problem
in coastal ocean modeling.
